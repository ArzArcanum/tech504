### Topic: String Methods
#   1. Trim spaces off the beginning and end of a string:
str_with_extra_spaces = "   extra spaces at the start and end   "
# Print the count of characters in the string (including spaces)
print (len(str_with_extra_spaces))
# prints the string after stripping the white space off each end of the string.
print(str_with_extra_spaces.strip())
#   2. Next use this starting code for the next set of subtasks
example_text = "here's some text with some words of text"
# count how many times the substring 'text' occurs within example_text & print it to the screen
